I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. I received my B.S. degree from the School of Mathematics and Computational Science at Hunan University of Science and Technology in 2016. I received my M.S. degree from the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the School of Cyber Security at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2020. I also spent 2 years (2020-2022) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen as a research associate. My major research interests are focused on Multimodal UAV tracking, Underwater Vision-Language Tracking, and Embodied Intelligence.
