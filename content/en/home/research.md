I like advancing Visual Effects and Autonomous Driving, as well as solving fundamental research problems arising from important challenges. I also like to explore the capability boundaries of new techniques on addressing challenges.

After the CVPR 2025 submission, I decided to pursue research projects that address crucial problems in the industry with significant impact. Such problems typically lack well-established solutions, necessitating us to explore new techniques and provide new insights. I would avoid participating in projects that lack both practical value and unresolved problems, as I believe they only produces useless papers, consuming my passion for research.

The following are my target systems:

- In the past few years, I have focused on developing two systems: Volumetric Video and Driving Simulator.

- Moving forward, I start working on Egocentric AI, which consists of three sub-systems: Lifelong Memory, World Model and Action Policy. The corresponding applications include AI Toys and AI Glasses
